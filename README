#compiled on Nunki.usc.edu with g++


#######Known Issue:
#      When I run this program on my local machine, Mac OSX 10.10, Xcode 6.1.1 and g++ 4.2.1
#      the adaptive huffman encoder  will produce error output file, with size larger than the expected ones.
#      It will only produce the correct output on the first run after a new compile.
#      However, this problem is not existing on Nunki server, so I do all the test and record the result on Nunki.
#      I can also run the program without any problem on my mac desktop, so I assume the problem is about the compiler or
#      environment on my laptop only. If you run the program with any issue on your local machine, please run it on Nunki

#######Compile and batch run instructions:
#      For compiling the program, cd to the directory of this README file and use < make -f README/gmake -f README > to compile the program
#      A instruction on execution parameters format will be shown
#      Follow the instruction for single run of certain algorithm and inpout data
#      For batch run on all algorithms and input data
#      cd to /debug folder and use make -f RUN/gmake -f RUN to run the batch script

#######Known issues
#      The run length and modified run length algoritms have some problem when running the decoding routines
#      The decoder will reach the EOF earlier than expected, but for the decoeded parts, the content is the same with the orginal one.
#      I have met the same issue on MTF transformation on my local machine, however it runs good on Nunki serve. But the RL and MRL will not
#      run perfectly on Nunki as well. I'm still debugging this part to see if I did anything wrong.
